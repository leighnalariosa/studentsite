        <article>
          <p>
            Leighna-Ann Lariosa was born on the south shore of O‘ahu. She would go to the public library each week and return home with mounds of fairytales, which her father read to her. She believes that’s what sparked her love for creativity.

            Leighna was always inspired by her beautiful home of Hawai‘i and expressed her love for it through watercolor and pen. She wanted her little illustrations to hold the power to prompt the most beautiful art of all—human emotion. She wanted her illustrations to bring delight to its spectator. She wanted to make people look around and be gratified for the life they lived, to ponder things they didn’t understand, to hold things dearer than they had before, to be in awe of the world. Even if she could make a single person see the way she saw the world through her illustrations, in all its wonder and beauty—she would feel grateful to be an artist.
            
            Leighna decided to pursue a degree in graphic design so she could lead a life in which she woke up every day and fulfilled her passion to create, to connect with others, to inspire. Her passion to sincerely give back to the place that inspired her art, shaped her perspective on life, and molded her into the human she was. Leighna believes art is a manifestation of the little bit of magic that is stowed in each of our souls—and through her art she’s discovering how to extract it and share it with others.
